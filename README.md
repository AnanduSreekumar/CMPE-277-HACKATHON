## Problem Statement:
In the face of increasing global food insecurity, exacerbated by macroeconomic factors such as inflation, income inequality, and market volatility, there is a pressing need for innovative technological solutions to mitigate these challenges. Despite numerous efforts, food security remains a critical issue affecting millions worldwide. To address this, our project aims to develop a mobile application that integrates macroeconomic research to offer actionable insights and tools for individuals, communities, and policymakers to effectively combat food insecurity.

## Key Challenges:
Macro-Micro Disconnect: There exists a gap between macroeconomic indicators and their real-world implications on food security at the household and community levels. Bridging this gap is crucial for developing targeted interventions.
Information Accessibility: Access to timely and accurate macroeconomic data and its interpretation is often limited, hindering informed decision-making and policy formulation.
Vulnerable Communities: Vulnerable populations, such as low-income households and marginalized communities, are disproportionately affected by macroeconomic shocks, leading to increased food insecurity.
Policy Effectiveness: Policymakers require comprehensive insights into the macroeconomic drivers of food insecurity to formulate effective policies and interventions that address underlying systemic issues.
Technological Integration: Integrating macroeconomic research into user-friendly mobile applications presents technical challenges, including data integration, analysis, and visualization.
